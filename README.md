## Overview
The Real-time Aviation Simulator with Sensor Data Processing and Reporting is an immersive project. This project offers a realistic flying experience by incorporating advanced features and cutting-edge technologies.

## Features
- **Real-time Cockpit/ATC Communication**: Interact with air traffic controllers in real-time, enhancing the authenticity of the simulation.
- **Air-to-Air Refueling**: Experience the intricacies of mid-air refueling, an essential aspect of aerial operations.
- **Autopilot Mode**: Automate flight operations with the autopilot mode, freeing up pilots to focus on critical tasks.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Stay informed with timely notifications about critical events and conditions during the simulation.

## Components
The simulator incorporates several essential components to provide a comprehensive aviation experience:
- **Primary Flight Display (PFD)**
- **Navigation Display (ND)**
- **Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)**
- **Engine Warning Display (EWD)**
- **Air Traffic Control (ATC) Radar**

## Big Data Integration
The project showcases the power of big data technologies in handling the continuous stream of sensor data generated by the simulation. Leveraging technologies such as Kafka, Spark Streaming, and Cassandra, we achieve efficient and effective data management throughout the simulation. Real-time variations in sensor data are visualized using Grafana, offering insightful representations for deeper data analysis.

## Acknowledgments
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our mentor, Professor Fouad Kharroubi, for their guidance and support throughout this project.
